# Stencil Components Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the Stencil components developed by me, Denise. These components are designed to offer efficient and reusable solutions for UI elements. Below, you'll find details about each component, how to use them, and more.

## Table of Contents

1. [app-component](#app-component)
2. [form-component](#form-component)

### 1. app-component

`app-component` is a Stencil component designed to provide a simple container for content.
